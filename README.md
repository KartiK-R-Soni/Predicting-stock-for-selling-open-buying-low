# Predicting-stock-for-selling-open-buying-low
In this project, I used the yahoofinance api to extract data of top BSE500 companies to a pandas dataframe and used numpy library for preddicting which stock will be the best fit for the strategy of buying at open and selling at low.
Additionally I have done a risk analysis as I am more of a risk averse person.
